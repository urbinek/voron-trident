# With this configuration, the fan will run at 100% anytime the chamber temperature is above 65C.
# based on temperature_fan:chamber_top:target_temp: 65
#
# The temperature is configurable later in gcode, ror example:
#
# Place a  in the start g-code to hold the chamber at a high temperature for the duration of the print
# Place a M141 S35 in the ending g-code to cooldown the chamber after a print is completed.
